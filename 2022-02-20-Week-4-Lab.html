  <h1>Week 4 Lab: WebOSINT [THM]</h1>
  
  <h2>Task 1: When A Website Does Not Exist</h2>
    <p>Read the introduction of what to do when a website doesn’t exist. They ask to look up RepublicOfKoffee.com on Google.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 1.png" alt="task 1" class="center"/>
    <p>It confirms that there is no actual website for the domain and hints that it is archived.</p>
  
  <h2>Task 2: Whois Registration</h2>
    <p>The objective is to find the domain’s registry information. The recommended sources are lookup.icann.org or any other service for a ‘whois’ 
    lookup. <br>I looked up the domain on ‘lookup.icann.org’ and through the terminal on the attackbox to see what options they each provided. 
    The terminal had more information available.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 2--part 1.png" alt="part 1" class="center"/>
    <p>I was able to answer the following questions: <br><b>What was the name of the company the domain was registered with? </b>   NameCheap Inc.
    <br><b>What phone number is listed for the registration company? (do not include country code or special characters/spaces)</b>    6613102107
    <br><b>What is the first nameserver listed for the site?</b>    DNS1.REGISTRAR-SERVERS.COM</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 2--part 2.png" alt="part 2" class="center"/>
    <p><b>What is listed for the name of the registrant?</b>    Redacted for Privacy <br>Now for the last question, this was hard to answer as 
    the listed country for the mailing address was IS or Iceland but that wasn’t right. So I looked at whoxy.com and found all owners of the 
    domain. Panama was the most recent besides Iceland.</p>

    <p><b>What country is listed for the registrant?</b>    Panama</p>

  <h2>Task 3: Ghosts of Websites Past</h2>
    <p>The new task was to actually view the site using Archive.org and/or the Internet WayBack Machine. So I searched the Wayback Machine for the 
    domain. I was given a calendar of when the site was archived.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 3--part 1.png" alt="part 1" class="center"/>
    <p>I clicked on the first available capture on Dec. 31st 2015 and was able to see the website for the first time.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 3--part 2.png" alt="part 2" class="center"/>
    <p>From the most recent blog posts I assumed the author was familiar from Gwangju so I Googled where that was and it’s a city in South Korea 
    where a popular place to visit is Mudeungsan Mountain National Park. It also listed a temple in the park.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 3--part 3.png" alt="part 3" class="center"/>
    <p>I was able to answer the following questions:
    <br><b>What city and country was the author writing from?</b>    Gwangju, South Korea
    <br><b>[Research] What is the name (in English) of the temple inside the National Park the author frequently visits?</b>    Jeungsimsa temple
    <br>To find out the author of the blog I went back to the Wayback Machine summary for the domain. I selected the ‘Site Map’ which looked like 
    this:</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 3--part 4.png" alt="part 4" class="center"/>
    <p>I clicked on the outer red ring which brought me to an actual blog post that had the author’s name and further confirmed they were writing 
    from South Korea.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 3--part 5.png" alt="part 5" class="center"/>
    <p><b>What is the first name of the blog’s author?</b>    Steve</p>

  <h2>Task 4: Digging into DNS</h2>
    <p>This task is to look at the technical information about the domain. I started this research by going to ViewDNS.info and looking up the IP 
    history.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 4--part 1.png" alt="part 1" class="center"/>
    <p>After clicking ‘Go’ the IP history is displayed.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 4--part 2.png" alt="part 2" class="center"/>
    <p><b>What was RepublicOfKoffee.com’s IP address as of October 2016?</b>    173.248.188.152
    <br><b>How many times has the IP address changed in the history of the domain?</b>    4
    <br>Then by doing a reverse IP lookup I was able to see what other domains are/were hosted on the IP that RepublicOfKoffee.com was associated 
    with from the previous question.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 4--part 3.png" alt="part 3" class="center"/>
    <p>There were others associated with the IP which answers:
    <br><b>Based on the other domains hosted on the same IP address, what kind of hosting service can we safely assume our target uses?</b>    
    Shared</p>
  
  <h2></h2>
    <p>Now the objective is to learn about heat[dot]net. I just stayed on viewdns.info and used the ‘Domain/IP Whois’ option.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 1.png" alt="part 1" class="center"/>
    <p><b>What is the second nameserver listed for the domain?</b>    NS2.HEAT.NET <br>Then I did an IP History Search and a Reverse IP Lookup.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 2.png" alt="part 2" class="center"/>
    <p><b>What IP address was the domain listed on as of December 2011?</b>    72.52.192.24</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 3.png" alt="part 3" class="center"/>
    <p><b>Based on the domains that share the same IP, what kind of hosting service is the domain owner using?</b>    Shared
    <br>I then went to the Wayback Machine site and searched heat.net.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 4.png" alt="part 4" class="center"/>
    <p><b>On what date was the site first captured by the internet archive? (MM/DD/YY format)</b>    06/01/97
    <br>I then looked at the last capture of 2001 which was a good-bye from the creators as they moved to another platform/website.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 5.png" alt="part 5" class="center"/>
  <p><b>What is the first sentence of the first body paragraph from the final capture of 2001?</b>    “After years of great online gaming, it’s 
    time to say good-bye.” <br>After that I searched “who created heat.net back in 1997” on Google and found out it was SegaSoft.</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 6.png" alt="part 6" class="center"/>
    <p><b>Using your search engine skills, what was the name of the company that was responsible for the original version of the site?</b>    
      SegaSoft<br>They also want to look at the capture for heat.net for 2010 which looks like:</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 4/Task 5--part 7.png" alt="part 7" class="center"/>
  <p><b>What does the first header on the site on the last capture of 2010 say?</b>    Heat.net - Heating and Cooling</p>
