  <h2>Task 2: <mark1>Common Attacks:</mark1> Social Engineering</h2>
    <p>Read about what social engineering is, the forms and staying protected from it. Watched the videos demonstrating 
      social engineering and the severity of what information can be obtained. Reading the Stuxnet Case Study provided the 
      answer for the question: What was the original target of Stuxnet?</p>
    <p>The answer is “The Iran Nuclear Programme.”</p>

  <h2>Task 3: <mark1> Common Attacks:</mark1> Social Engineering: Phishing</h2>
    <p>Read the information about phishing and the different types/subcategories. I clicked on the “Visit Site” button at the 
      top of Task 3.</p>
    <p>Determine if the email is safe or not:</p>
  <p>Email 1</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 3/Task 3--Email 1.png" alt="email 1" class="inline"/>
  <p>When hovering the pointer over the link the URL doesn’t match and should be approached with caution as a potential 
    phishing email.</p>
  <p>Email 2</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 3/Task 3--Email 2.png" alt="email 2" class="inline"/>
  <p>The sender’s email doesn’t match the official sender email. There should be two g’s. Also, the link doesn’t look safe. 
    This proves the email to be a phishing email.</p>
  <p>Email 3</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 3/Task 3--Email 3.png" alt="email 3" class="inline"/>
  <p>The sender looks official with no typos or unfamiliar words and the link is correct for the THM website confirming the 
    email is safe.</p>
  <p>Email 4</p>
  <img src="Images/Lab 3/Task 3--Email 4.png" alt="email 4" class="inline"/>
  <p>The sender is unfamiliar and so the PDF should be viewed as suspicious. This email is most likely a phishing email.</p>
  <p>Finding the Flag:</p>
  <p>After completing the Phishing Test, a flag is displayed to submit for the last question.</p>
