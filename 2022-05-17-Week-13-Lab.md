## **WEEK 13 LAB: Wifi Hacking 101\[THM\]**

Summary: “Learn to attack WPA(2) networks!”

**Task 1: The Basics - An Intro to WPA**

We learn about WEP, WPA and WPA2. For the most part they are different in terms of security features but mainly we want to note WPA2 uses a 4 way handshake for authentication and anything we can exploit in WPA, we can most likely do for WPA2. To ingrain this new material let’s answer some questions and search through google:

> \[Infer from reading\] What type of attack on the encryption can you perform on WPA2 personal? Brute force

> \[Infer from reading but here’s an explanation from a [Google](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29602/is-it-possible-to-use-the-aircrack-ng-tool-to-crack-a-wpa2-enterprise-network) search\] Can this method be used to attack WPA2-EAP handshakes? Nay

> \[Infer from reading\] What three letter abbreviation is the technical term for the “wifi code/password/passphrase”? PSK

> \[Search on Google\] What’s the minimum length of a WPA2 Personal password? 8

**Task 2: You’re Being Watched - Capturing Packets to Attack**

This task talks about the aircrack-ng suite and how it can be used to attack WPA networks. It’s also good to note that we can’t enable monitor mode unless our host device has monitor mode on the NIC.

To answer the questions we need to learn some more about aircrack-ng. I did this by going to the [aircrack-ng Wiki](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=Main) and looking at the list of tools/modes available. 

The first mode we should look at is [airmon-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng) which enables monitor mode. The command ‘airmon-ng start wlan0’ starts monitor mode on the wlan0 interface.

> How do you put the interface “wlan0” into monitor mode with Aircrack tools? airmon-ng start wlan0

The interface will change as shown:

![wlan0mon interface](https://github.com/Tarroyo-rgb/CSCI_17_SP22/blob/main/Images/Lab%2013/%5B1%5D%20wlan0mon.png)

> What is the new interface name likely to be after you enable monitor mode? wlan0mon

To check other processes on the desired interface the following command will notify of any conflicts and kill them:

![interface conflicts](https://github.com/Tarroyo-rgb/CSCI_17_SP22/blob/main/Images/Lab%2013/%5B2%5D%20interface%20conflicts.png)

> What do you do if other processes are currently trying to use that network adapter? airmon-ng check kill

Another tool available with aircrack-ng is airodump-ng. This tool allows us to capture WPA handshakes.

> What tool from the aircrack-ng suite is used to create a capture? Airodump-ng

Airodump-ng has lots of options including flags to filter for certain access points using the netmask, cipher suite, BSSID, and/or ESSID.

> What flag do you use to set the BSSID to monitor? --bssid

We can also specify the channel we want with either a provided channel or a specific one:

![channel flags](https://github.com/Tarroyo-rgb/CSCI_17_SP22/blob/main/Images/Lab%2013/%5B3%5D%20channel%20flags.png)

> And to set the channel? --channel

To dump these capture packets to a file we can use the --write option with a provided prefix which will be the file name.

> And how do you tell it to capture packets to a file? -w

\[Note: you can also specify what file type you would like to be created for the output with the -o flag and these file options: pcap, ivs, csv, gps, kismet, and netxml. If an output type isn’t specified then a pcap, csv, kismet.csv and kismet.netxml file will be created automatically\]

**Task 3: Aircrack-ng - Let’s Get Cracking**

For this task we will actually crack a WiFi password using aircrack-ng by first downloading the task files. The files are as shown:

![task files](https://github.com/Tarroyo-rgb/CSCI_17_SP22/blob/main/Images/Lab%2013/%5B4%5D%20task%20files.png)

To use aircrack we’ll need to specify what AP we want to target and the wordlist we want to use. These flags can be found in the aircrack-ng help page. 

> What flag do we use to specify a BSSID to attack? -b

> What flag do we use to specify a wordlist? -w

Also in order for us to actually crack the password though we have to convert the capture file into a hashcat capture file so that aircrack can run the pcap file through hashcat. This is the same as using a file with hashes but it’s being generated from the capture file.

> How do we create a HCCAPX in order to use hashcat to crack the password? -J

Then to actually crack this password! We’ll use aircrack-ng with the options we mentioned above and specify the capture file we want to use:
```
Aircrack-ng -b 02:1A:11:FF:D9:BD -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -J task NinjaJc01-01.cap
```

![password found](https://github.com/Tarroyo-rgb/CSCI_17_SP22/blob/main/Images/Lab%2013/%5B5%5D%20password%20found.png)

> Using the rockyou wordlist, crack the password in the attached capture. What’s the password? greeneggsandham

When we run password cracking tools they will use the GPU as it has more cores than a CPU that allows faster processing power. This [article](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/hack-and-password-cracking-gpus-part-i-setup) explains this more in depth than my one sentence explanation.

> Where is password cracking likely to be fastest, CPU or GPU? GPU
