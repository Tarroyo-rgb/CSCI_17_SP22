<h2 class="text">Task 2: Offensive Security</h2>

<p class="text">The second task of the room provides a brief description of what the offensive side of cybersec does, some individual qualities that would make a 
  career in this role a good fit, and the knowledge required.</p>
<p>A link is provided for the beginner pathway for giving a good foundation when starting this career path and a question asking what career role is 
  legally employed to find vulnerabilities in applications which is a penetration tester. I read the material and answered the question, then continued.</p>

<h2 class="text">Task 3: Defensive Security</h2>

<p class="text">This task focuses on the defensive side of cybersec or blue team. The different levels of response to attacks are described by providing the roles 
  that take care of some of them. Along with each role [Security Analyst, Incident Responder, and Malware Analyst] there are recommendations for rooms 
  on THM that cater to each. The Cyber Defense pathway is recommended for continuation into this section.</p>
<p class="text">The last part of the task is to answer a question with the correct role that matches the description. Security Analyst is the role that works specifically
  to detect malicious/unauthorized activity and is the answer to who identifies attacks against organizations. I read the material and answered the 
  question, thus completing the room.</p>
